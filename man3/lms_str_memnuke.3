.Sh NAME
.Nm lms_str_memnuke
.Nd Over-write the contents of a memory buffer with zeros
.Sh LIBRARY
-lmsocket
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In msocketutils.h
.Ft void
.Fo lms_str_memnuke
.Fa "volatile void *b"
.Fa "size_t sz"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function 
.Fn lms_str_memnuke
will over-write 
.Fa sz
bytes of memory from the pointer referenced by 
.Fa b
with zeros.  This is useful for clearing a memory buffer which contained, for example, a clear-text password.  Calls to 
.Fn free
do not zero the memory, so another application could conceivably allocate memory which contains sensitive data from another application.  Calling
.Fn lms_str_memnuke
on the buffer prior to calling 
.Fn free
on it will prevent this potentially dangerous condition.  
.Sh CAVEATS
The 
.Fn lms_str_memnuke
function cannot indicate an error, for example if it returns prematurely because a null-pointer was passed to it.  
It required that 
.Fa b
be cast (volatile) in order to prevent compilers from optimizing it out so that memory is safely wiped.
